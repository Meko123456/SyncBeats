 * At most [max] chars of this text, never ending in half of a surrogate pair.

 * Most emoji are two chars (a surrogate pair), and track and playlist titles are full of them. A
 * plain `take(max)` whose cut falls between the two keeps the first half alone, which isn't valid
 * Unicode: it shows as a broken character, and on the way to the database it turns into "?".
 * Here the cut moves back one char instead, so an emoji across the cap is left out whole.
